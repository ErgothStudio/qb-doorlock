### QB-DOORLOCK with GANG INTEGRATION

I don't know if anyone has done this, but anyway I would like to make available a small adaptation that I made so that the illegal can also close and open doors without having to have a job.
When the player is arrested, he leaves without work, reducing the players' work when they leave prison, without the need to set something again.

# All rights reserved to Qbus, I just made an adaptation!
